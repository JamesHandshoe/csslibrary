		<h3>Purpose of CSS</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>To give the outside of the site a unique look and feel.</li>
				<li>To alter colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc.</li>
				<li>To implement some effects and animations, although it's not as powerful as jQuery.</li>
			</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper">
		<h2>CSS Statements</h2>
			<p>Four main components include the following: </p>
				<ol> 
					<li><b>Declaration: </b>the statement as a whole with curly braces.</li> 
					<li><b>Selector:</b> the name of the part you want to style.</li>
					<li><b>Property:</b> properties to edit(e.g., width, height, background, etc.)</li>
					<li><b>Value:</b> numbers, colors, urls - values that we assign. </li>
				</ol>
			<p>Here's a photo to illustrate these items:</p>

		<h2>CSS Setup</h2>
		<p>You must link the CSS and HTML files so they can 'talk' to each other.</p>
		
		<p>The way to do this is to put a link to the CSS file in the html. A couple things to remember when doing this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Put the link in the head tags of the html file</li>
			<li>If the CSS file is on the same file level as the HTML file, put the file name in quotes after an href tag.</li> 
			<li>If not, you need to make sure you put the correct file path. </li>
			<li>After you've linked the files, do a simple test to make sure the link is working. </li>
			<li>This could be as simple as changing the background color of the body.</li>
